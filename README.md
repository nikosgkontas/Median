# Median
 Calculating the Median of a List of Numbers
<br>
<br>
This script defines a function median(a) that calculates the median value from a list of numbers. The function first checks if the input is a list, then sorts the list and determines the median based on whether the number of elements is even or odd. If the input is not a list, it raises a ValueError. The function returns the median value, providing a simple way to find the central tendency of a dataset.
